# Python Modern Workflow

In this repository, I have set up a modern Python development workflow using a combination of cutting-edge tools and best practices aimed at increasing productivity, ensuring code quality, and maintaining security throughout the project lifecycle.

### Tooling and Best Practices
This workflow integrates several industry-standard practices and tools that promote high-quality software development:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code to ensure that every feature is properly tested, reducing bugs and improving code stability over time.
- **GitHub Actions**: A powerful CI/CD platform used to automate testing, linting, and other workflows. This ensures code is consistently checked for quality and correctness with every commit or pull request.
- **Codecov.io**: A code coverage tracking tool that integrates with GitHub Actions, providing insights into the test coverage of the codebase and helping maintain high test quality.
- **ReadTheDocs.io**: Automatically generated, continuously updated documentation hosted online, making it easier for users and contributors to understand the project.

### Packages and Libraries

To ensure maintainability, security, and ease of use, this workflow leverages several essential Python libraries and tools:

- **Poetry**: A robust dependency and packaging manager that simplifies dependency management, virtual environment creation, and version control for Python projects.
- **Sphinx**: A documentation generator used to create detailed, structured, and easy-to-navigate documentation. It integrates with ReadTheDocs.io to automatically host and update the documentation.
- **Black**: An automatic code formatter that enforces a uniform code style across the project, improving readability and reducing friction during code reviews.
- **isort**: A tool for automatically sorting and organizing imports, keeping the codebase clean and compliant with Python style guidelines.
- **Flake8**: A code linting tool that checks for PEP 8 compliance, common syntax errors, and other potential issues, ensuring the code adheres to Python's best practices.
- **Bandit**: A security linter that analyzes Python code for common security issues, helping to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **Safety**: A tool for checking dependencies against a database of known vulnerabilities, ensuring that third-party packages do not introduce security risks.
- **PyPI**: This project is structured and ready for packaging and distribution via PyPI (Python Package Index), making it easy to distribute and install.


### Why This Workflow?

This modern Python workflow is designed to promote code quality, security, and maintainability from the outset. By integrating continuous integration tools like GitHub Actions and Codecov.io, automated testing and code quality checks are performed on every code change, ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks.

The combination of Black, Flake8, and isort ensures that the code follows best practices and is consistently formatted, making it easy to read and collaborate on. Tools like Bandit and Safety add an extra layer of security by scanning both the code and its dependencies for potential vulnerabilities.

Using Poetry for dependency management simplifies the process of managing and publishing the project, while Sphinx and ReadTheDocs ensure that the documentation stays up-to-date and easily accessible to all stakeholders. With support for distribution on PyPI, this workflow is ideal for building and maintaining scalable Python projects that are ready for deployment and distribution.
